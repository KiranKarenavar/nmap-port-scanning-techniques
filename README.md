# nmap-port-scanning-techniques

📌 Overview

This project explores 15 different Nmap port scanning techniques performed in a controlled home lab environment.
The goal is to understand enumeration methods, packet behavior, firewall responses, and how scans appear in Wireshark.

📘 Scans Performed
ACK Scan
FIN Scan
NULL Scan
Protocol Scan
Ping Scan
SYN Scan
TCP Connect Scan
UDP Scan
Windows Scan
XMAS Scan
ICMP Ping
SYN Ping
TCP Ping
Normal Output
XML Output

🎯 Learning Objectives
→ Understand how Nmap identifies open/closed/filtered ports
→ Analyze packet behavior in Wireshark
→ Study firewall filtering responses
→ Document scan results like a real SOC analyst
→ Improve hands-on cybersecurity skills

🛠️ Tools Used
    ✔ Kali Linux
    ✔ Nmap
    ✔ Wireshark
    ✔ VirtualBox
